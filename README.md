**About this repository**
<br>
Sudoku Solver using backtracking and brute forcing - LaPlateforme Formation 


**Get started**

using the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Sudoku-Solver
python3 main.py

```

A more user-friendly way:

```bash
cd ~/Sudoku-Solver
python3 pygame_soduku.py

```

Benchmarking: The goal here is to compare the execution time of (1) brute force vs (2) backtracking method on 5 files
that can be found in the 'soduku_puzzles' folder (Average execution time of these files).

```bash
cd ~/Sudoku-Solver
python3 benchmarking.py

```

=> The backtracking method is better because it takes less time compared to the naive resolution of the brute forcing
